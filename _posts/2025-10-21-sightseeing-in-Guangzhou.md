# sightseeing in Guangzhou

I have lived in Guangzhou for 7 years, and for a long time in the past, I was always busy with work and rarely went out.
This year I have the leisure to go wherever I want.

## Guangzhou Zoo (广州动物园)

I went to Guangzhou Zoo on October 19th, ahead of the 15th National Games free ticket distribution date (October 20th), because
there might be more visitors by then. The adult ticket price is 20 RMB.

## Yuntai Garden (云台花园)

Because free tickets are given out for the 15th National Games, the adult ticket price is 0 RMB.

Today is October 21st. Ths weather is cool and since it is a weekday, there aren't many visitors.
