# a leisure day

It's a leisure day, I went to the cinema to watch a movie named EVA and had dinner at Saizeriya Italian Restaurant.

It's the first time that I have ever gone to Saizeriya Italian Restaurant and eaten snails.

The full English title of the movie is [EVANGELION:3.0+1.0 THRICE UPON A TIME](https://www.evangelion.jp/final.html), which is translated into Chinese as 天鹰战士：最后的冲击 or 新世纪福音战士新剧场版：终.

The ending song of the movie 'One Last Kiss' is great.
