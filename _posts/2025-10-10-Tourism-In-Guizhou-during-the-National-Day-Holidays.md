# Tourism in Guizhou during the National Day Holidays

## About this year's National Day Holidays

Due to this year's National Day holiday is more than a week long, lasting 8 days, I planned to travel to Guiyang for two weeks ago.
In the previous 4 days, I stayed at home and had a rest.

## Arrive in Guiyang

I leave home at 12 PM and board the high-speed train from GuangzhouNan Railway Station(广州南站) to Guiyang at 2 PM.

After more than 5 hours I arrived at Guiyang Railway Station(贵阳火车站), I first took Metro Line 1 from Guiyang Railway Station(贵阳火车站地铁站) to Beijing Road Station(北京路站), then transferred to Line 3 from Beijing Road Station(北京路站) to Mingzhu Avenue Station(明珠大道站), and then took a taxi to my hotel booked through the Fliggy(飞猪) app in Huaxi(花溪) District.

## The 1st Day: Visit in Guiyang

I eat 陈氏人家豆米火锅（花溪店）last night, and wandered around the Huaxi Park(花溪公园) after a meal.

Today is also the traditional Chinese festival: Mid-Autumn Festival(中秋节), So there are many people crowded the walking street.
