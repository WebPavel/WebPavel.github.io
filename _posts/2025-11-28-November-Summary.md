# November Summary

On November 3rd, I went to the cinema to watch a movie titled EVA, a Japanese anime that is very popular online in China but which I had never watched before.

I upgraded my phone, which I had used for almost 7 years, from an iPhone XR to an iPhone 17.

The reasons that prompted me to upgrade my phone were its sluggish response and the state subsidy (国补).

## Tips on what to prepare before buying a new iPhone

| 2. | phone cases       | drop protection          |
| 3. | charger plug      | connect the power supply |

After each shopping trip, I use the Notes app on my iPhone to scan the shopping list and append it to my food list.

This makes it very convenient to repurchase things I like and plan what snacks I will eat each week.

## Pick up new debit card of Industrial Bank (兴业银行)

Since my Industrial Bank debit card is about to expire, I made an appointment to renew it on the mobile app on November 5th.

For the new card type, I chose the Industrial Bank Global Life Standard Card (兴业银行寰宇人生普卡), and for the pickup method, I chose to pick it up at a branch.

After applying through the mobile app, I received an official short message indicating that it would take 10 business days (工作日) to reissue the new debit card.

In fact, on November 12th, I received an official short message indicating that the new debit card had been delivered to the designated branch and that I could pick it up.

After I picked up my new debit card at the branch, the bank staff gave away a 5-kilogram bag of rice to me as a reward when I made a deposit.

- Industrial Bank (Development Zone Sub-branch)<br/>兴业银行广州开发区支行
- Kexue Avenue No.249 Headquarters Economic Zone Block A8 Floor 1-2<br/>广东省广州市黄埔区科学城科学大道 249 号总部经济区 A8 栋 1、2 层

## Guangzhou International Light Festival (2025 年广州国际灯光节)
